- Access: Local terminal and SSH
- Package Management: apt
- Services: systemd
- Logging: journalctl

## Tasks Performed

### Package & Software Management
- Installed, updated, and removed software packages
- Verified package versions and update status

### User & Permission Management
- Created and managed local users and groups
- Assigned permissions using chmod and chown
- Validated access boundaries

### Service Management
- Managed services using systemctl
- Verified service status and startup behavior

### System Updates
